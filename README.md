# Calculus-J.S-8th-python-cas
using python to solve problems, among other things 


Full descritipon:

HI EVERYONE!!! This is a collection of notes and python program files for the James Stewart Calculus textbook, 8th edition (Single Variable Calculus Early Transcendentals).

Why am I doing this? 
-- I have a deep love affair with electronics, programming, and mathematics. As time went on, I noticed my skills could drastically improve if I started to take more initiative. Why I chose Python for this is mostly due to its easy-to-use environment and syntax, while also being free and having a robust math-related library. Unfortunately, most textbooks that deal with any sort of CAS -- computer algebra system -- will do so by using Mathematica and or Maple (both of which aren't free); Python became the natural choice for me. 

Why make a GitHub repository of this?
-- Why not? I can organize all my info and files here while also making them available for anyone else who is interested in this. 

How will this be organized?
-- I'll make it as simple as possible: from the main branch, it'll split off into the chapters and their respective sub-sections, as well as the end of chapter ones.

Note about handwriting:
-- I have atrocious handwriting, so I apologize for that in terms of the notes, but the program files, being typed and all, will be clear to view. 

Can I ask you a question?
-- Of course you can. I'll be putting a Discord username in here at one point, and you can reach me there for any questions or support.
